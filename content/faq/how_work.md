Next Release creates release notes by importing your pull requests and categorizing them automatically,
with almost no developer effort.

How We Make Release Notes:

-   Use pull request titles (and optionally bodies) to generate notes
-   Automatically organizes release notes with configurable labels and headers
-   Share shipped release notes on Github, Slack notifications, Email Reports, and more
