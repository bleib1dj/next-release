Release notes are the single, unified way of sharing your product changes
with anyone, regardless of their position and technology stack. Release
notes let you communicate, manage, and track your releases without endless
back and forth and with little effort by those who need to find out what shipped.

### Communicate Changes to Everyone

Whether you work among multiple cross functional teams or in a highly siloed
organization, release notes are how you share exactly what other teams need to
know. You can be using completely different toolchains from your peers and still
get the updates you need to understand what actions your team needs to take.

### Developers

If you’re developing services, release notes are your way to tell other teams
what changes you’ve made to your interfaces.

### QA Teams

If you’re on a quality assurance team, release notes are your way to
understand what other teams are expecting you to test and where you can
find the updates.

### Sales/Customer Support

Even sales and customer support rely on release notes to understand what
is available to customers and which bugs have been fixed.

### Your Customers

Just as with internal teams, release notes are your means to notify and
showcase your latest updates to your customers. Allowing them to understand
what bugs have been fixed and which new features are ready for them to utilize.
It doesn't matter if your product is an open source package, an autonomous
vehicle, or a mobile game; customers expect you to tell them what’s in the new
release and why they should be downloading it.

## Manage Releases

Managing multiple systems can be a nightmare. Keeping release notes sheds light
on which systems and services are compatible with others, which updates create
breaking changes that others must react to, and enables teams to identify which
releases should be in what environments. Release notes reduce the chance of
integration issues that plague even simple applications, and help teams to
quickly identify holes and issues that otherwise wouldn’t have been caught
until validation tests started, saving valuable time and resources.

## Track

Whether you’re deploying one release a month or a release an hour, having a
historical record of what was deployed when, is critical. Release notes give
you a record to report up the chain what’s been done recently and how those
changes have been communicated to customers. Having release notes enable
development teams to quickly identify when certain code was launched, improving
their ability to react to issues and deploy patches.
