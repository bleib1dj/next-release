## Overview

Four key metrics measure development and delivery practices, how long it takes a
team to make a change, how often they deploy updates, the time it takes to restore
service after an outage, and how often their changes lead to problems in production.
These performance measurements have been tested across multiple industries and company
sizes and are a consistent way to help organizations track their ability to achieve their
goals.

These four gauges provide a view into a team's delivery processes throughput and
stability. We utilize the DevOps Research & Assessment organization's method of
measuring these values in the following ways:

-   Throughput is measured by:
    -   Lead Time for Change: The duration between the time of checking in a change to the time the team
        releases it into production.
    -   Deployment Frequency: How often a team deploys code to production.
-   Stability is measured by:
    -   Mean Time to Restore (MTTR): The time it takes detecting a user-impacting incident to having
        it resolved.
    -   Change Failure Rate: The percentage of changes to production that result in degraded service

We include these measurements within each of your Performance Release Notes to help you and
your team stay focused on your continuous improvement objectives of:

-   Reduce wasted development effort
-   Increase ability and confidence to deploy on-demand
-   Free up team's time by automating and optimizing processes
-   Reduce the time it takes to identify and recover from a failure
-   Reduce the number of failures that make it into production

By improving on these key areas, your team will be able to achieve higher performance
and increase the availability of your product, helping to improve your customer relations
and reduce the overhead placed on other groups within the organization such as customer
support and sales.

## Integration

We can integrate our Performance Release Notes with most toolchains and teams. If your organization is in the
early days of your DevOps journey and you do not have tools to connect with, we'll work with you to build out
your fist minimal development and delivery pipeline. If you already have a system in place we'll instrument
it for you. Last but not least, if you're somewhere in between, we'll help you add in the components that are
the best fit for your team's unique requirements.
