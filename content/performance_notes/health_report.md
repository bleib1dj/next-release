## Overview ## 
Development and delivery practices are often measured by four key metrics, 
how long it takes a team to make a change, how often they deploy updates,
the time it takes to restore service after an outage, and how often their 
changes lead to problems in production. These performance measurements 
have been tested across multiple industries and company sizes and are a
consistent way to help organizations track their ability to achieve their
goals. 

These four gauges provide a view into a team's delivery process' throughput and 
stability. We utilize the [DevOps Research & Assessment](https://cloud.google.com/devops) 
organization's method of measuring these values in the following ways:

* Throughput is measured by:
  * **Lead Time for Change**: Time of checkin of a change to it being released.
  * **Deployment Frequency**: How often your team deploys code to production.
* Stability is measured by:
  * **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**: The time it takes from detecting a user-impacting incident to having it
  resolved.
  * **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of changes to production that result in degraded service

We include these measurements within each of your Performance Release Notes to help you and 
your team stay focused on your continuous improvement objectives of:

* Reduce wasted development effort
* Increase ability and confidence to to deploy on demand
* Free up team's time by automating and optimizing processes
* Reduce the time it takes to identify and recover from a failure
* Reduce the number of failures that make it into production

By improving on these key areas your team will be able to achieve higher performance and
increase the availability of your product, helping to improve your customer relations
and reduce the overhead placed on other teams within the organization such as customer
support and sales.


## Integration ##
We are able to integrate our Performance Release Notes with most toolchains and teams.
If your team is just setting out on your DevOps journey and you do not have tools for us to connect with we'll
work with you to build out your fist minimal development and delivery pipeline. If you 
already have a system in place we'll instrument it for you. Last but not least, if you're
somewhere in between we'll help you add in the components that are the best fit for your
team's unique requirements.
