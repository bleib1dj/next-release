## Overview

When everyone on the team is moving fast it's difficult to keep up with all the features and bug
fixes that are flowing into different environments. Pull requests help indicate what exactly changed
but can be difficult to comprehend, especially when you're not a developer. We see teams overcome this
by adding screenshots of the new features into their pull requests and release notes but it can be easy
to overlook issues when only taking a snapshot. That's why our Performance Notes include a video walkthrough
showcasing what has changed for every release. These videos:

-   Rapidly find bugs prior to changes being released to production
-   Help developers root cause issues by providing step by step guides on what happened during the walkthrough
-   Increase engagement and alignment with stakeholders by telling a story about what changed
-   Validate changes and provide content for sales demonstrators, customer support inquiries, and marketing
-   Supplement traceability and proof of testing to comply with industry standards and regulations such as [ISO 26262](https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html)

## Integration

Based on your team's structure we have a couple ways of integrating showcases. Our recommended approach
is that we provide the team members making changes the ability to take the vidoes and submit them for
integration into the Performance Release Notes. By having them generate the videos it helps to shorten the feedback
loop on bug fixes while also allowing them to put their own personal touch on what they are releasing.
The developers we work with tend to like this approach the most since they get to show off what they've
been working on and it often replaces delays currently caused by traditional sprint retrospectives where
team members had to wait until the end of the sprint to showcase their hard work.

If that approach doesn't work for you, we also provide a white glove approach where we
act as a quality assurance extension. We'll partner with your developers to understand what has
changed in a given release, record a showcase of those features, provide the them with feedback
on what did and didn't work, and publish a finalized video once they are ready to release it. This
has the added benefit of having a third party testing out the feature as if they were a sales executive
or customer success representative and providing faster feedback to those working on the changes.
