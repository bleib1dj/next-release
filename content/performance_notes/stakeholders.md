There are a thousand perspectives for every release. How does a frontend change impact the 
team members working on the backend, how does a feature update impact sales pitches and demos, 
how will a change impact customer relations and what should be communicated to who in order to 
see if it has shifted their net promoter score? 

Evangelizing changes to the right stakeholders in
a way that relates to them and is focused on what matters to them is time consuming but critical. That's why
we manage customizing a section of your Performance Release Notes for each unique stakeholder 
that your team impacts. This allows for stakeholders to easily zero in on what changes in an upcoming
release impact them and allow them to quickly engage on the topics that matter to them.
