There are a thousand perspectives for every release. How does a frontend change impact those
working on the backend, how does a new feature impact sales pitches and demos, or how will
a bug fix affect customer relations? Each stakeholder has different concerns they're focused
on, which is why we provide you with a one-pager per stakeholder for every release that
delivers the information that matters to them.

Evangelizing changes to the right stakeholders in a way that relates to them and focuses
on what matters to them is time-consuming but critical. Our tailored one-pagers allow
stakeholders to quickly zero in on what changes in an upcoming release affect them and
enable them to engage on the topics that matter to them immediately.
