## Overview

Every change your team deploys to production is an attempt to move the needle
on a business objective, whether that's increased customer usage, reduced system
overhead, faster load times, or improved conversion on upselling items. That's why
in every Performance Release Note, we include how those changes impacted your
company's top priority key results.

To accomplish this, we coordinate with you and your team every quarter to review
which metrics matter the most to you and gain access to tools you are using to measure
those results or setup the tooling necessary to track them. We then incorporate how
these metrics are trending from release to release so you and your team can have all
the metrics you care about in a singular easy to access a place that you can share with
others.
