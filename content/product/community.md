## Communicate Updates

Keep your users current on all the changes you and your team are making to your product.
Join hundreds of other teams who already share their release notes on their favorite social networks
by enabling one of our integrations like Twitter.

## Gather Feedback

Recruit beta users for new features, give people a place to comment on bug fixes
and interact with customers about their thoughts on the update. Every engagement on
your release adds to the chances of your update going viral.

## Build & Maintain Your Community

Foster a healthy community built on communication and transparency.
Give your members a public location to easily interact with you using a
platform they're already using.
