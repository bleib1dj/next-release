## About Next Release

Our team is focused on making product teams more effective
through developer operations. We help teams break down communication
barriers and improve alignment. We’re a Michigan based company serving
software developers around the world.

## Our Mission

Make every product release a success.

Effective communication is critical for companies and employees
to be successful. Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise, and it’s
hard to determine what really matters. It doesn't have to be that way.

By helping companies automate capturing the most essential parts of
what has been achieved in their most recent product release, we give
people the best insights to what has been accomplished and who needs
to take action without all the pain. In short, we help people get the
feedback they need to increase engagement and action, know where they
stand, and reduce the amount of noise and issues that occur with their
software releases.

Product releases are the most critical recurring event within an
organization - our goal is to make every one a success.

## Who We Are

We’re a team that believes in execution and accomplishments over expertise;
We care more about how effective you are at translating your existing knowledge
into results, and an unwavering drive to continuously improve yourself, bringing
more success to the mission.

### What We Do

We care about making product releases a success because better releases mean
less stress, more time for solving challenging problems, better team relationships,
and better companies.

When release documentation is easy, developers develop, product managers engage
with customers, QA teams know what needs to be tested, customer support knows
what customers need to be prepared for, sales teams are more effective, and marketing
knows what’s really going to be launched.

### Our Daily Values

We’re looking for people who align with our principal framework.

#### Team, Teammates, Self - The Narwhal Family

We put the success and wellbeing of the company above the individual. We put the
success and wellbeing of our colleagues above our own. We are coaches and students.
We succeed as a team and fail as a team.

#### 10x Thinking & Measuring What Matters

The best work is done when we all align behind a set of objectives that enable
us to set personal objectives that force growth. We recognize that greatness
takes grit and only comes to those who think and act ten times larger than their
competition.

We work to define our objectives, track our progress based on movement towards
key results, and keep persisting after everyone else has gone home and nobody
is watching. It is our duty to achieve success for our teammates.

#### Transparency

We know that having a false sense of reality is the quickest way to demise. That
is why we advocate transparency and consciously reject silos and barriers. Knowing
the reality of the here and now is a superpower that enables every team member to
most effectively support the company, help their team members grow, and know where
they need to be improving themselves.

#### What’s Next

We have an unyielding passion to grow, to improve, and to find new opportunities
to help others.

Once we meet an objective, we view it as having won the opportunity to play the
game again and find new horizons we can cross.
