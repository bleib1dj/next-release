###Software Security

Our team keeps our software and its dependencies up to date eliminating potential security vulnerabilities. We
employ a wide range of monitoring solutions for preventing and eliminating attacks to the site.

###Communications

All data exchanged with Next Release is always transmitted over SSL (which is why your dashboard
is served over HTTPS, for instance).

###Data Storage

We never store passwords as clear text – they are always hashed (and salted) securely using bcrypt.
Both data at rest and in motion is encrypted – all network communication uses TLS with at least
128-bit AES encryption. The connection uses TLS v1.2, and it is encrypted and authenticated using
AES_128_GCM and uses ECDHE_RSA as the key exchange mechanism.

###Maintaining security

We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. Login information is always sent over SSL.

We also allow you to use two-factor authentication, or 2FA, through GitHub login as an additional
security measure when accessing your Next Release account. Enabling 2FA adds security to your account
by requiring both your password as well as access to a security code on your phone to access your account.

###Credit card safety

When you sign up for a paid account on Next Release, we do not store any of your card information on
our servers. It’s handed off to Stripe, a company dedicated to storing your sensitive data on PCI-Compliant servers.
