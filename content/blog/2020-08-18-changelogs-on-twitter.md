Twitter has become one of the leading platforms for teams to publish
their release notes to. This is driven by the vibrant developer community
that lives on Twitter as well as the format of tweets aligning well with
quick iterative updates on software solutions. These two aspects create a
great forum to gather input from contributors and enable supporters to
share updates with friends and colleagues.

## Community Engagement Platform

![Twitter Community Engagement Platform](../../src/images/blog/twitter_integration/twitter_changelog_accounts.png)

Leaders in developer operations such as GitHub and Heroku dedicate
entire twitter accounts to managing their changelog notifications,
helping others stay up to date with what has been changed, fixed, and
deleted from their systems. These accounts give their teams feedback
on what has been deployed, enabling sentiment analysis of core features
as well as identification of bugs that users find and share.

### Rapid Feedback

Socializing changelogs on twitter allows for others to easily share your
notes with others and comment about them on their own feeds. This allows
team members to vocalize their thoughts on recent releases and lets customers
give you feedback quickly so that you can make better decisions going forward.

This is why teams like Reactjs and Ethereum use Twitter to encourage early
adoption of alpha and beta releases so that more bugs + security
vulnerabilities can be found before production deployment, helping to
reduce change failure rates, time to resolution, and cost of fix.

### Engagement, Collaboration, Support, and Sharing

Building a community around your product takes consistent connection
with your team, your customers, members who rely on your subject matter
expertise, and your partners. Release notes are an excellent touchpoint
that provides a focal point to collaborate with each of these stakeholders
and twitter offers a hosted platform to engage on. By using twitter you
gain access to the existing developer communities that already exist and
can avoid building and maintaining your own custom portal.

### Brand Building & Awareness

Like building a community, building your brand means staying consistent
when engaging with customers. Twitter gives you the ability to showcase
your team’s brand via small snippets of content around your releases and
via transparent responses to users who engage the release. Using your
twitter account to engage with your community outside of release notes
helps to garner additional followers, which in turn increases the amount
of people who see your latest releases, which drives additional engagement
& sharing, that can help facilitate wider adoption and usage.

### Lead Generation

As you build your brand and reputation on Twitter, the platform becomes an
organic lead generation solution that targets individuals who can benefit
from your solution and puts your information in front of them. You can also
utilize your tweets and changelogs to prompt existing users and prospects to
checkout updates you’ve made to your application. A great way to do this is
by sharing snippets of what has been updated and providing followers with a
link to the full release note or the actual area of your software that has
been modified.

### Security Improvements

Security threats continue to grow and with [75% of vulnerabilities being
caused by indirect dependencies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-than-75-of-all-vulnerabilities-reside-in-indirect-dependencies/)
it’s critical that package managers notify
teams relying on their product about security fixes as quickly and loudly as
possible. By incorporating Twitter into your community engagement ecosystem
you’re able to quickly notify teams of security updates that your team has
made and empower the community to share those updates.

### Increase Feature Adoption

Release notes let customers and prospects know what new things your team
has added to your product. If your changelog isn’t shared with users they
have to learn about changes by stumbling across them when using your package
or platform. Since your users are already on Twitter it’s a great way to get
new enhancements in front of them so that they can try them out.

## Catalog of Changelog Examples

There are a multitude of ways to share your release notes on Twitter. Here
are a few of the concepts that we built our [automated release note tweet
generator](https://www.nextrelease.io/blog/tweet-your-changelog-on-twitter) off of.

### Minimalist Release Tweets

Minimalist release notifications are most common for larger releases that
follow longer release cycles such as those followed by major frameworks
like EmberJS & Django Web Framework.

![Django Minimalistic Changelog Tweet](../../src/images/blog/twitter_integration/change_example_django.png)

### Hook Release Tweets

For medium to long release notes another option is a hook release tweet.
This type of tweet provides a tease of what is included within the latest
release but directs followers to get out of twitter and come to a team’s
product site to find out more.

![Oculus Developers v15 Hook Changelog Tweet](../../src/images/blog/twitter_integration/change_example_oculus.png)

### Context Thread Tweet

Some teams like to provide additional information around a release. Whether
it’s to provide context to the release or pre-emptively engage with your
community this is the direction you’ll want to take.

### Full Changelog Tweet

For smaller, more iterative releases some teams like to capture the entire
release note in their tweet so that their community can quickly identify if
there are changes that impact them and whether or not they need to take any
action. Taking this approach enables these users to do all of this from
twitter without needing to load additional pages or leave the twitter interface.
