Twitter has become one of the leading platforms for teams to share
their release notes on. In the last 15 days, over 700 organizations posted more than
800 changelogs to the platform receiving over 9,700 likes and 15,500 retweets.
This has been and continues to be driven by the vibrant developer community
that lives on Twitter, as well as the format of tweets aligning well with
quick, iterative updates on software solutions. These two aspects create a great forum
for gathering input from contributors and enabling supporters to share updates
with friends and colleagues.

## Community Engagement Platform

![Twitter Community Engagement Platform](../../src/images/blog/twitter_integration/twitter_changelog_accounts.png)

Leaders in developer operations such as GitHub and Heroku dedicate
entire Twitter accounts to managing their changelog notifications, helping
others stay up to date with what has been changed, fixed, and deleted from
their systems. These accounts give their teams feedback on what has been deployed,
enabling sentiment analysis of core features and identifying bugs that users find
and share.

### Rapid Feedback

Socializing changelogs on Twitter allows your community members to easily share your notes with others and
comment about them on their feeds. This enables team members to vocalize
their thoughts on recent releases and lets customers give you feedback quickly
to help your team make better decisions going forward.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Aha, that changelog. I guess they’re now at a negative bug count? <a href="https://t.co/YB7AaMFDRx">pic.twitter.com/YB7AaMFDRx</a></p>&mdash; Holly Graceful (@HollyGraceful) <a href="https://twitter.com/HollyGraceful/status/1292517064859684869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Super excited about this release 🤩<br><br>We built all the missing parts to make Fast Refresh work really well consistently. Huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dan_abramov</a> for collaborating on this.<br><br>You can now try out Incremental Static Generation on your website which allows dynamic to become static. <a href="https://t.co/lenO3U20eN">https://t.co/lenO3U20eN</a></p>&mdash; Tim (@timneutkens) <a href="https://twitter.com/timneutkens/status/1259875881453043714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is why teams like Reactjs and Ethereum use Twitter to encourage
early adoption of alpha and beta releases so that more bugs and security
vulnerabilities can be found before production deployment. This helps to reduce
change failure rates, time to resolution, and cost to fix.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In case you missed it, we published React 17 Release Candidate.

### Engagement, Collaboration, Support, and Sharing

Building a community around your product takes consistent connection
with your team, your customers, members who rely on your subject matter expertise, and your
partners. Release notes are an excellent touchpoint that provides a focal point to
collaborate with each of these stakeholders, and Twitter offers a hosted platform to
engage on. Using Twitter, you gain access to the existing developer communities
and can reduce the need for building and maintaining your own custom portal.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We found and disclosed an input-validation bug in the Go standard library: encoding/binary ReadUvarint and ReadVarint.

### Brand Building & Awareness

Like building a community, building your brand means staying consistent
when engaging with customers. Twitter lets you showcase your team’s brand
via small snippets of content around your releases and via transparent
responses to users who engage the release. Using your Twitter account to
engage with your community outside of release notes helps to garner additional
followers, which in turn increases the number of people who see your latest
releases, which drives further engagement & sharing, helping to facilitate broader
adoption and usage.

### Lead Generation

As you build your brand and reputation on Twitter, the platform becomes an organic
lead generation solution that targets individuals who can benefit from
your solution and puts your information in front of them. You can also
utilize your tweets and changelogs to prompt existing users and prospects
to check out updates you’ve made to your application. A great way to drive
people to your site is by only sharing snippets of what has been updated. By
providing a teaser and a link to the full release note or the actual area of
your software that you updated, you can move interested community members to a
more vibrant version of the release notes.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⚛️ Preact 10.4.7 is out now 🚀<br><br>- 💫 Suspense fixes<br>- 🥽 Warn on invalid hooks usage in effect functions<br>- 🐳 Usual round of bug fixes<br>- 🦊 Compat TS type improvements<br><br>Changelog:<a href="https://t.co/CFA4pzBxx4">https://t.co/CFA4pzBxx4</a></p>&mdash; Preact (@preactjs) <a href="https://twitter.com/preactjs/status/1291123835224436738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Security Improvements

Security threats continue to grow. With [75% of vulnerabilities being
caused by indirect dependencies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-than-75-of-all-vulnerabilities-reside-in-indirect-dependencies/),
package managers must notify teams relying on their product about
security fixes as quickly and loudly as possible. By incorporating
Twitter into your community engagement ecosystem, you’re able to promptly
notify teams of security updates that your team has made and empower the
community to share them.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Go 1.14.7 and 1.13.15 have been released!<br><br>🔐 A security fix for encoding/binary (CVE-2020-16845)<br><br>📢 Announcement: <a href="https://t.co/7Bz70sISsD">https://t.co/7Bz70sISsD</a><br><br>⬇️ Download: <a href="https://t.co/VZdWl0TDqK">https://t.co/VZdWl0TDqK</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/golang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#golang</a></p>&mdash; Go (@golang) <a href="https://twitter.com/golang/status/1291419822220345351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Increase Feature Adoption

Release notes let customers and prospects know what new things your
team has added to your product. If your changelog isn’t shared with users,
they have to learn about changes by stumbling across them when using your
package or platform. Since your users are already on Twitter, it’s a great
way to get new enhancements in front of them so that they can try them out.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next.js 9.4:<br><br>◆ React Fast Refresh<br>◆ Incremental Static Regeneration (beta)<br>◆ New Environment Variables Support<br>◆ Built-in Fetch Support<br>◆ Web Vitals Reporting<br>◆ Absolute Imports and Aliases<br>◆ Configurable Sass Support<br>◆ Improved Log Output<a href="https://t.co/slHw3kG4ZU">https://t.co/slHw3kG4ZU</a></p>&mdash; Vercel (@vercel) <a href="https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1259866549319618560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Catalog of Changelog Examples

There are a multitude of ways to share your release notes on Twitter. Here
are a few of the concepts that we built our [automated release note tweet
generator](https://www.nextrelease.io/blog/tweet-your-changelog-on-twitter) off.

### Minimalist Release Tweets

Minimalist release notifications are most common for larger releases that
follow longer release cycles, such as those followed by major frameworks
like EmberJS & Django Web Framework.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ember 3.18 is released! Read more about it here: <a href="https://t.co/UiKlGXMUu7">https://t.co/UiKlGXMUu7</a></p>&mdash; EmberJS (@emberjs) <a href="https://twitter.com/emberjs/status/1257732359165825024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Django 3.1 release candidate 1 released <a href="https://t.co/og6D1BrDxO">https://t.co/og6D1BrDxO</a></p>&mdash; Django (@djangoproject) <a href="https://twitter.com/djangoproject/status/1285106449291632640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Hook Release Tweets

For medium to long release notes, another option is a hook release tweet.
This type of tweet provides a tease of what is included within the latest
release but directs followers to get out of Twitter and come to a team’s
product site to find out more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Solidity 0.6.7 is out! 🚀 It introduces support for EIP-165 via `type(InterfaceName).interfaceId` and allows virtual modifiers inside abstract contracts to have an empty body.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Major Update 1.196 is out! 😁<br> <br>Big changes to server performance and block collision. 🤨<br> <br>Get all the details here: 🤓👇<br> <br>Changelog: <a href="https://t.co/AceOjgIInd">https://t.co/AceOjgIInd</a><br><br>Blog: <a href="https://t.co/CS7nRoZMGy">https://t.co/CS7nRoZMGy</a><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpaceEngineers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpaceEngineers</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Innovation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Innovation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Space?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Space</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Science?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Science</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeedtoCreate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NeedtoCreate</a> <a href="https://t.co/FBv2eEM49L">pic.twitter.com/FBv2eEM49L</a></p>&mdash; Space Engineers (@SpaceEngineersG) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceEngineersG/status/1291750817997844482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, we’re releasing the first Release Candidate for React 17!

### Context Thread Tweet

Some teams like to provide additional information around a release. Whether
it’s to provide context to the release or pre-emptively engage with your
community, this is the direction you’ll want to take.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">💎New release alpha.22 is up 💎<br><br>Thread ⬇️<a href="https://t.co/Jxt7XqBUEV">https://t.co/Jxt7XqBUEV</a></p>&mdash; Prysmatic Labs (@prylabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/prylabs/status/1295130519022125056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Full Changelog Tweet

For smaller, more iterative releases, some teams like to capture the entire
release note in their tweet so that their community can quickly identify if
there are changes that impact them and whether or not they need to take any
action. Taking this approach enables these users to do all of this from
Twitter without needing to load additional pages or leave the Twitter interface.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Catalyst 20.05 is here,<br>- user-friendly Notebook API<br>- improvements for Config API<br>- new features: gradient tracking, extra loggers support, etc<br>We also separate framework into 3 rigorously tested parts: catalyst, catalyst[cv] and catalyst[nlp] <a href="https://t.co/WZMyeH9UzU">pic.twitter.com/WZMyeH9UzU</a></p>&mdash; Catalyst.Team (@catalyst_core) <a href="https://twitter.com/catalyst_core/status/1258653177521594368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
