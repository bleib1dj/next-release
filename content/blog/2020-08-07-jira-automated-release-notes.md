Product development spans multiple tools that each hold key
information, critical to understanding the context of a release and
the impact it has on the broader business objectives. That's why we're
excited to announce the opening of alpha enrollment for Jira automated
release notes.

We're still in the early phases of development and are looking for teams
who utilize Jira as their primary project management platform. If you're
using GitHub for repository management, that's a plus but not required to
enroll.

Just like with the automated release notes we generate for teams using
GitHub for project management, we're developing our Jira integration to
track changes made to a product autonomously. We'll utilize these changes
to generate release notes throughout the product life cycle, delivering
them to the right stakeholders at the right time.

If you'd like to apply for the alpha program, have feature requests, or
questions, [contact us](https://www.nextrelease.io/contact).
