The murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor is a continuation of
the systemic racism and inequality that impacts our neighbors, colleagues, friends,
and family.

We believe that diversity, equality, and inclusion result in sustainable communities,
which is why we’re committed to these values. In response to this disease, we’re
starting an ongoing monthly contribution to [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/),
[Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/), and [Black & Brown Founders](https://blackandbrownfounders.com/).

In addition to our support to these programs, we’ll step up our contributions and
involvement with STEM programs in metro Detroit through [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/)
to help remove barriers of entry to technical skill-building. Lastly, starting today, we’ll be
providing free access to our developer tools to minority-owned businesses during their
first three years of usage.

We will continue to listen and learn from community leaders who are on the frontlines
combating this ongoing plague. We support Black Lives Matter and their protests in
support of the Black community. We condemn violence of any kind, especially from the
state on its civilian population.

We know that these steps are small but believe that consistent small actions made by
all of us can result in the massive change necessary to combat this ongoing virus and
produce a better future for everyone.
