[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is the web framework for
perfectionists with deadlines which is
why we’ve been using it for over ten years to build applications that can
be automatically tested within docker containers, deployed, and scaled to
support growing customer bases. We started by utilizing the full Django
framework including the integrated templating language. Since frameworks
such as Ember.js, Angular.js, and React.js have since been developed we’ve
opted to use these Javascript frameworks in place of it. Instead we pair
Django with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#) (DRF)
to use Django to build out scalable
RESTful APIs that can be accessed by frontend applications, mobile
applications, IoT devices, and other systems that need to engage with
the platform.

Django helps us improve the throughput and stability of our applications
by providing an awesome object-relational mapper (ORM) and a vibrant
community of developers who have built out packages like DRF, PyLint,
and Black. We’re proud to support the community as a monthly sponsor and
to see all their accomplishments in their [release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/).
