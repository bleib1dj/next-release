### Tired of Being Asked "What Shipped Last Week?"

If you're tired of being asked what got shipped and when, Next Release Reports may be your answer!

With Next Release, in under 3 minutes, you can set up your repository to automatically create release notes
and automatically publish them to your key stakeholders whenever you create a new release, or send a custom
summary of changes across multiple projects on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis.

You can also email individual release notes on an adhoc basis or setup our Slack notifications
to keep your team informed in real-time.

With fine-grained controls, you customize the right set of reports for teams in product, sales, support,
_and_ engineering.
