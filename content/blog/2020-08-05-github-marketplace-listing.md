## GitHub Marketplace Listing

We’re on GitHub Marketplace! If you’re looking to manage your subscription
through the GitHub marketplace, you can now
[find us through it](https://github.com/marketplace/nextrelease-io) :D. We’re
the only Github release note generator that doesn’t require any code
modifications and provides you with automated release notes, version management,
git tagging, and changelog file updates.

## Automatic Release Drafter

After you setup Next Release through our site or GitHub Marketplace, we’ll start
tracking the pull requests for all the projects you indicate you’d like release
notes created for. Once pull requests are merged, we’ll draft a release note for
you and your team that you can review and edit. This release note will contain
information about the changes that have been made and automatically generate a
new semantic version.

## Version Management

There’s no need to worry about what version your latest release is or figure out
which value in your semantic version to increment. We handle all that for you to
track releases easily, understand what versions of code are running where, and
rollback deployments if an issue makes it into one of your environments.

## Git Tag Management

Once you’re happy with the release note, merge in the release pull request, and
we’ll generate a git tag using the auto-generated semantic version along with a
[GitHub Release](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-releases).
This will allow contributors to access each of your releases the
same way they’re used to accessing releases in other repositories.

## Changelog File Control

If you also want a changelog generated for you that documents your release
notes and versions within a file committed to your repository, you can
utilize our changelog file manager, [it’s live](https://github.com/nextreleaseio/next-release/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) :).

We’ll catch you over at the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/nextrelease-io)!
