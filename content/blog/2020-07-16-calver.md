We’re big advocates of semantic versioning; we believe using semver provides the right
mix of readability, scalability, and ease of use. There are other versioning options out
there though, and I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss calendar-based versioning a bit.

Calendar versioning, aka calver, as the name implies, is a versioning release schema based
on some form of datetime. Some examples of this form of versioning are:

-   YYYY.Minor.Micro
-   YYYY.MM.DD
-   YYYY.Minor
-   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss,ns

Using calendar versioning tends to lend itself to waterfall methodologies or strict
release cycles where releases are cut on a specific date, and individuals or teams are
not empowered to make modifications in real-time. Many organizations use calendar versioning
for customer relations while maintaining a semantic version under the hood to enable rapid
iterations internally and abstracting end-users from what can appear as untethered numbers.

Taking a dual approach has some additional overhead but can ease communication with customers,
align releases with longer deployment cycles, and enable teams to push updates in real-time to
non-production environments and still know which versions they’re operating with. If you only
use a calendar versioning approach, you’ll probably run into scalability issues where multiple
releases are created in a single day or potentially even simultaneously, resulting in the need
to expand your versioning schema.

If you’d like additional information on calendar versioning or other schemas you can utilize,
