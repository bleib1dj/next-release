As we’ve discussed in past articles there are four key metrics used to measure
the performance of developer teams, lead time to change, deployment frequency,
mean time to restore, and change failure rate. With these four metrics you
can gauge the throughput and stability of your development pipeline.
Monitoring these values over time helps to determine if new tools, processes,
or culture are helping or hindering your team’s performance and highlight
where your time would be best spent to improve the team’s output.

Since it can be difficult to monitor these metrics across your pipeline we’ve
added a dashboard that tracks them for you. To see how your organization is
doing, navigate to your organization settings and click on the “Metrics” tab. This
will take you to a dashboard providing an overview of how your entire
organization is performing.
