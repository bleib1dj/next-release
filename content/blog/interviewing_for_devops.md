Companies are hiring for DevOps centric roles or looking for developers that can help manage
the gap while revenue or investment allow for dedicated team members. Here are a few
questions you can expect to come your way as well as a few that will help you get a
feel for the software supply chain your potential team is working with.

## Availability

How do you measure availability of non-development environments?
Combination of mean time to resolution, change failure rates, and resulting uptime per customer segment based on region, usage, and interface (web, mobile, IoT device generation, etc).
How do you plan to keep systems up while deploying updates?
How do you plan to keep systems up when an update fails to roll out?
How are you going to maintain availability when a bug makes it out into production?

Stability
How do you measure the stability of the developer pipeline and how can release management support reaching those objectives?
Focus on mean time to restore and change failure rates.
RPO / RTO of systems
Where are they at on benchmarks for these?
How have they been working to improve them so far?
Where do you want to take them?
How are you going to get there?
What’s the budget they are on?
Do they allow open source solutions?
Are they constrained to a specific type of environment configuration?
What have you done on past projects to improve the stability of your team's development pipeline, how did it impact the pipeline, the team, and what would your next objective be based on your learnings?
How do you influence activities occurring upstream from you?
Cite Supply Chain Book
Get involved with teams, help them to adopt processes and deliver input on them to make them better. Work with development team members and operation team members especially if people are wearing both hats.

Throughput
How do you measure the throughput of the release system?
Focus on lead time for change and deployment frequency
How many contributions (commits, PRs, etc) are coming in per minute or hour? What types of systems are currently being used?
What have you done on past projects to improve the throughput of your team's development pipeline, how did it impact the pipeline, the team, and what would your next objective be based on your learnings?
How do you integrate hardware with virtualized testing? (Mobile apps, IoT, etc)
How would you manage legacy hardware platform releases?

Security
How do you measure the effectiveness of security around releasing software?
Focus on how you prepare systems to identify, contain, remediate, and recover.
Where are they currently at in their existing benchmarks?
Where do you want to take them?
How are you going to get there?
What’s the budget they are on?
Do they allow open source solutions?
What kind of compliance challenges are relevant to the industry?
What are your thoughts on ISO 27k, SOC2, HIPAA, or other industry standards specific to the company’s industry?
How resilient do you aim to make the release process?
Resilient enough that an intern can be hooked into the pipeline and contributing first week of being hired. (Need a day to get them setup, connected, and integrated)
How do you ensure remote access to the pipeline?

Experimentation
How do you measure the success of your changes to a development process?
How do you deal with the human element of modifying tools and processes?
How do you coordinate support and training for new workflows?
Culture
Determine what kind of culture they have
Will you define how you help the company succeed, will tasks be dictated to you, or something in between?
Avoid organizations that are authoritarian unless you have buy in from top executives to support you in transforming it into performance oriented
Read More on DevOps Culture Code
Set ambitious goals with measurements of success, baseline and benchmark your system to understand reality, diagnose problems, design minimal solutions, implement, deploy, gather feedback, learn and repeat
Put honest thoughts on the table
Have thoughtful disagreement
Abide by agreed upon ways of getting past disagreement
Goals, Problems, Diagnosis, Design, Doing
Should shine through with options of solutions: Technology Background (Experience deploying things)
