Velocity - The measure of how quickly your team can build features, bugs, enhancements, or
complete story points. Why is this how teams measure success? Popular tools have
evangelized it as the quintessential method, but it isn’t how we should be figuring
out the performance of our teams. Instead, we should be gauging the velocity of something else.
The velocity of our team reaching company objectives.

Company objectives are not features, user stories, or job stories. They are where we want
to be in the future and how we measure being there. A new feature is an idea that is worth
testing with users to see if it moves the needle on reaching our company objectives. Publishing
more of them may or may not get us to that future quicker. Some might even take us in the
opposite direction, increasing technical debt and ongoing overhead. There are plenty of
frameworks out there to help set up achievable objectives; I’d recommend Andrew Grove’s
Objectives and Key Results (OKR) as evangelized by John Doerr in [Measure What Matters](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Measure_What_Matters/u2NDDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0) and
used by [Google, LinkedIn, and Intel](https://medium.com/okrs/a-crash-course-okr-googles-secret-sauce-fd562080ba94).

The TLDR on objective frameworks is to set aspirational goals, define how you measure
their success, figure out what your current reality is, break down the steps to get from
that current reality to your goals, and then get started. To figure out how to make
progress on your key results, the measurements of successfully reaching your objective,
you build out experiments that track what impact your actions have on moving the needle.
These experiments can be adding a feature, creating an enhancement, writing a blog post,
providing updated training material, or anything the team is doing to try and achieve
their key results. A great way to architect these experiments and measure them can be
found in the [LEAN Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) by Eric Ries, who
defines an experimentation framework.

At the meta-level, our goal is not to measure success by the number of experiments we
can do but instead how effective our experiments are at helping us move the needle
towards each of our company objectives. This effectiveness can come in how quickly we
learn what reality is and whether we should pivot or persevere in our actions.

It is easy to fall into a pattern where we believe the next feature will
increase our user base or solve a problem we’re having. This anti-pattern, unfortunately,
can turn into busy work that isn’t helping the team accomplish its goals. Having
alignment on what our overarching objectives are, and being able to measure where we are,
spotlights whether a new feature is having an impact or if we need to pivot our
efforts. That is why measuring the velocity of obtaining defined key results is a better
bellwether that enables us to identify emerging gaps and rally behind teammates who are
facing them to ensure we’re accomplishing our goals.
