We recently released a dashboard showcasing your development team's
performance at the organization level. The panel has its limits and doesn't
allow you to dig into how specific projects or team members contribute to
your organization's overall performance. Without more granular insights,
it's challenging to determine where which projects are struggling the most,
what languages & frameworks have the most significant gaps, or which team
members need additional support. To help dig into the causes behind your
organization's performance metrics, we've added project-level performance metrics.

To understand how each project impacts the wider company numbers, you can navigate
to a specific project, select settings, and click on the Metrics tab.
