Informing team members or customers of upcoming changes helps to reduce
the number of changes that result in your solution operating worse.
Having a lower percentage of change failures helps to improve the stability
of your team's platform, and builds the confidence needed to enable deploying
changes multiple times a week.

## Reduce Complications from Increased Deployment Frequencies

As your team increases its deployment rate, it puts a heavier demand on
communication between teams that had previously used multiple meetings a
week to get aligned on what was coming out in the subsystems of the product.
Initial symptoms of this occurring are increasing system integration bugs,
increasing frustration due to miscommunications relating to changes, or spikes
of effort aggregated around releases.

## Automate Synchronization with Development Teams

Integrating advance release notifications allows for teams to reduce the
pressure of reoccurring meetings and transition to a process of optional ad-hoc
inquiries based on the identified changes. They provide other developers with the
features and bug fixes coming up in a release, as well as links to the code associated
with those changes.

## Reduce time to alignment with other teams

In addition to aligning engineers, advance release notices can be tailored
per stakeholder so that other teams can get a heads up on what they need
to be preparing.

-   Quality Assurance: Identify what functions that are impacted by the change
    and should have smoke tests run by the quality assurance team.
-   Sales: Indicate bug fixes and features will be available so that they can
    provide feedback, learn, and integrate them into upcoming customer engagements.
-   Marketing: Outline enhancements and resolutions so that they can prepare announcements,
    promotions, and relevant outreach.

## Increase Transparency and Traceability

By distributing notifications to everyone a release impacts, before deploying it,
informs everyone on the team of what has changed and allows them to prepare. This
data breaks down silos of information and creates a log for when there are questions
about what was impacted in past releases, enabling teams to optimize their operations
further.
