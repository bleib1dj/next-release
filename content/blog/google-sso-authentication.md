Release notes should be shared. They have essential information that team
members focused on sales, marketing, customer support, and other business
areas need to accomplish their day-to-day tasks effectively. Release notes
help everyone on the team stay on the same page, which is why weâ€™ve added
the ability to log into Next Release with Google.

This new authentication method gives team members the ability to access
information about releases without the need for a GitHub account. Instead
of managing access to code bases and requiring your team to dig through
repositories to find updates, they can now access organization-wide release
notes for every project they care about in a single location.
