Using tags when posting your release notes to Twitter lets
you share your notes in specific content streams that other users
monitor and subscribe to. Some of these content streams allow you
to engage with your community members and new groups. GitHub has
a tag, #GHReleaseRadar, dedicated to monitoring software
releases. By including this tag in your release note posts,
your updates are sent to GitHub's teams for entry into their
monthly Release Radar post. Their team takes their favorite
updates and writes up a short story about the update like they
did in their [2020 September Edition](https://github.blog/2020-09-04-release-radar-september-2020-edition/).

Entering your releases into the competition is a great way to
prospect for additional exposure and keep the GitHub team
engaged with the updates your team is pushing out. To make it
even simpler to enter to win inclusion in their blog post, we've
added a setting that lets you automatically
include #GHReleaseRadar in every release note you publish to
Twitter.

To enable this setting, go to the project you'd like to
include the tag in Twitter posts on. Navigate into that
project's settings, select Notifications, and click the
slider to the right of "Enable GitHub Release Radar Tag".
