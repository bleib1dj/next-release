We've built Next Release to bring many of our favorite parts of the open-source software development
process to organizations of all sizes.

We want to clarify our pricing for open-source projects and highlight many of the features that can benefit open-source
teams.

### Free Usage for Any Public Repository

We've [updated our pricing to make all public repositories free](/pricing) with Next Release. Any public repository you
add to Next Release won't count toward a billing plan.

### Automatic Changelog Management

With a flip of a toggle, Next Release will automatically update you're changelog with your automatically built
release notes. No more scripts to manage!

### Tag and Publish Releases

By default, Next Releases uses your pull requests to categorize and version your releases with SemVer, automatically
creating a customizable version tag and publishing a Github Release.

### Custom Repository Events

We also dispatch custom events back your repository via [Github's `repository_dispatch`.](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#external-events-repository_dispatch)
You can use this to handle building artifacts, updating documentation sites, or publishing to package registries.
